<p align="center"> Archery game simulator based on Monte Carlo method
    <br> 
</p>


## About

This simulator based on the Monte Carlo method recreates 20,000 archery games between two teams based on certain pre-established conditions through the pseudo-random generation of n shots for each archer until his resistance ends in 10 rounds per game based on success probabilities, according to sections of the bull's-eye based on their gender. At the end of the simulation, statistics (values and graphs) are obtained according to cumulative calculated variables.
